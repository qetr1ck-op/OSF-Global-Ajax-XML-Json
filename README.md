This task was done when I was on intership in OSF-global on direction - JavaScript

Short description, I need to create XML or JSON document with the which holds information:
--------------
- in task I should had as many objects(in this task there was dots) as senting me from the server;
- dots form server had positions -x -y, color, description and link;
- I dinamycalli parsed them and correctly set them in DOM in map, with properly attributes;
- create a posibility to show any of dots or all of them;
- when in map dots we hover over on each dot should be tooltip-popup with description and special link with close button;

For achieve this task I follow steps:
